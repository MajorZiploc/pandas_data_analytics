The D-45 represents the most elegantly appointed dreadnought in Martin's standard collection. You get it all with this guitar: a luxurious sound, gorgeous appointments, and the kind of play-ability that makes you want to pick it up again and again. It's no coincidence that prewar D-45s are some of the most sought-after guitars in the world — and not just because they're so rare; the D-45 model is simply the pinnacle of Martin's premium brand.

The G2622 Streamliner puts a genuine Gretsch semi-hollowbody electric guitar in your hands for less. This guitar doesn’t skimp on quality, however. It delivers an incredibly snappy, open tone, thanks to its 5-ply arched maple body. Broad’Tron pickups balance out the Streamliner’s tone beautifully. A weight-relieved spruce center block imbues the Streamliner with true hollowbody tone while also keeping feedback under control — even in high-gain situations. The Gretsch G2622 Streamliner delivers classic big-body sounds at a reasonable price.

When you want a '50s-era Gretsch guitar tone, you need real Gretsch 
humbuckers. That's why Gretsch gave the G5222 Electromatic Jet a pair of
 Blacktop Broad'Tron pickups. These humbuckers give you traditional 
Gretsch growl and grit, as well as deliver pristine clean tone when 
needed. In addition, individual pickup volume controls, master tone, and
 master volume with treble bleed circuit provide exceptional tonal range
 and control, putting you in the driver's seat as you explore your own 
style.

The PRS 35th Anniversary SE Custom 24 is here to celebrate 35 years of guitar making and innovation. Designed around the one that started it all, the Custom 24, this limited-edition model captures the foundational elements of an iconic model and adds the musical functionality of the Paul’s Guitar, creating a new, versatile platform. The 35th Anniversary SE Custom 24 features TCI “S” treble and bass pickups with two mini-toggle switches that allow players to put either or both pickups in humbucking or true single-coil mode. The clarity and unique tones of these vintage-inspired pickups are both big and nuanced, so players can easily find their sweet spot.
Additional features include a 24-fret wide thin neck, abalone “old school” birds, and PRS’s patented tremolo design.
After selling out of all 3,500 Black Gold Wrap Burst 35th Anniversary SE Custom 24 Guitars, PRS is offering a second run of this model in Faded Blue Burst. Fewer than 3,000 Faded Blue Burst guitars will be available worldwide.

It’s time to rethink what an acoustic-electric guitar can do. Do you 
want to play leads all the way up the neck? Play longer? Play louder? 
Now you can with this super-comfortable, easy-to-play acoustic-electric 
from Martin. The all-new SC-13E, with its patent-pending 
Sure Align® neck system, gives you full access to all frets so you can 
comfortably reach those high notes. It’s also equipped with a new, 
low-profile velocity neck barrel that ergonomically accommodates your 
hand as you move up the neck, giving you the comfort and playability of 
an electric. It was designed from the ground up to be 
plugged in, and its asymmetrical body shape provides balanced output, 
giving you more gain before feedback. So the next time you’re on stage 
with an SC-13E, go ahead, play it loud. But, don’t forget,
 the SC-13E is still a Martin, so it sounds amazing unplugged. And with 
the limitations of the conventional cutaway acoustic-electric removed, 
you can now play your way, any way, without limits. SPECSString Type: SteelNumber of Strings: 6Body Shape: SinglecutLeft-/Right-handed: Right-handedColor: NaturalFinish: GlossTop Wood: Sitka SpruceBack & Sides Wood: Koa veneerBody Bracing: Scalloped X-bracingBinding: WhiteNeck Wood: Select HardwoodNeck Shape: Low Profile VelocityRadius: 16""Fingerboard Material: EbonyFingerboard Inlay: Mother-of-PearlNumber of Frets: 20Scale Length: 25.4""Tuning Machines: Nickel Open GearBridge Material: EbonyNut/Saddle Material: White Corian/White TusqNut Width: 1.75""Electronics: Fishman MX-TStrings: Lifespan 2.0 92/8 Phosphor Bronze, .011/.052Case Included: Softshell CaseManufacturer Part Number: 11SC13E-01

Introduced in 1954, the Strat has flaunted its svelte body curves, tonal

future with a fast-action 22-fret maple neck, vibrant vintage-inspired 
finishes, and three Player Series Alnico 5 Strat pickups that deliver 
all the legendary spank and sparkle you expect from a Strat.

Lafayette, LA 70506*FREE SHIPPING - USA ONLY* The
 PRS Silver Sky is an idealized version of a vintage single-coil guitar 
where every detail adds up and sets this guitar apart from the pack and 
the past. The result of a close collaboration between Grammy 
Award-winning musician John Mayer and Paul Reed Smith, the Silver Sky is
 based off of years of development. Incorporating Mayer and Smith’s 
favorite elements of 1963 and 1964 instruments with an eye toward modern
 references, the PRS Silver Sky delivers the warmth and familiarity of 
an old guitar with the finesse of a brand-new instrument. Some
 of the more distinctive specifications include, the headstock shape, 
tuners, bridge, pickups, and neck and fretboard options. The headstock 
shape is based on PRS’s trademark design, but inverted both to 
accommodate Mayer’s playing style and also to keep a consistent length 
of string behind the nut, which makes staying in tune easier. The tuners
 are a traditional vintage-style, closed-back tuner, but with PRS’s 
locking design. The steel tremolo takes the patented PRS design and 
incorporates Gen III knife-edge screws. Setup flush to the body in the 
neutral position so that the tremolo bridge only goes down in pitch, the
 bridge’s increased contact with the body allows the guitar itself to be
 acoustically louder, which in turn improves the signal to noise ratio 
of the single-coil pickups. The 635JM single-coil pickups are very round
 and full, with a musical high end that is never “ice-picky” or brash. Body Type: SolidbodyBody Shape: Silver SkyLeft-/Right-handed: Right-handedNumber of Strings: 6Body Material: AlderBody Finish: GlossColor: Polar BlueNeck Material: MapleNeck Shape: 635JMRadius: 7.25""Fingerboard Material: RosewoodFingerboard Inlay: PRS Bird

Though the original Stratocaster was first introduced more than 60 years ago, it's unquestionably more popular now than ever. The Player Series Stratocaster combines the guitar's sleek, elegant lines with the perfect blend of vintage and modern features. You start with the classic comfort-contoured alder body with a gloss polyester finish, then add a 3-ply parchment pickguard and a trio of Player Series Alnico 5 Strat single-coil pickups. The Strat's original master volume plus two tone pot configuration left the bridge pickup without a tone control; but in the Player Series Strat, Tone 1 operates on both the neck and middle pickups, while Tone 2 is dedicated to the bridge pickup.

With the 000-12E Koa in Martin’s lineup, now more players can turn their dreams of owning a koa guitar into reality. The back and side of this gorgeous model are constructed with koa fine veneer, which is an environmentally conscious, alternative-wood option, made by bonding koa hardwood to an African mahogany core. The result is the show-stopping look of a koa guitar at a great price. But there is so much more to this guitar. Aside from the balance and comfort of the 000, you will get mother-of-pearl-patterned rosette and fingerboard inlay, a full-gloss body, a soft-shell gig bag, Fishman® MX-T electronics, and Martin’s Authentic Acoustic Lifespan® 2.0 strings. With all that, the 000-12E Koa is worthy of any stage.

Fender's 5th-gen noiseless pickups, called Ultra Noiseless, land you all
 the spanky, quacky Strat goodness without any annoying hum. Seriously —
 plug it into a Plexi and crank it. The Ultra Noiseless Vintage Strat 
pickups remain full of character and light on noise. The American Ultra 
Strat has a silky-smooth 5-way switch that gives you loads of tones to 
choose from. When you engage the volume knob's S-1 Switch, you can add 
neck-position tones to positions 1 and 2 — position 1 giving you bridge 
and neck pickups together, position 2 giving you all three pickups at 
once.

progressive metal scene thanks to their complex rhythms and soaring 
melodies. Guitarist Mark Holcomb helps achieve this full, lethal sound 
with his PRS guitars and signature Seymour Duncan Alpha and Omega 
pickups. PRS and Holcomb have worked closely together to develop a truly
 unique guitar for the SE Series lineup. ""With my SE 
signature model, we managed to capture all of the defining 
characteristics of my Maryland-made guitar and turn it into a 
streamlined, less-costly package. It is an incredibly special 
instrument, and one that is now the primary focus of my rig in the 
studio and onstage."" - Mark Holcomb, Periphery The SE Mark
 Holcomb model truly stands on its own in the PRS lineup and delivers 
addictive playability thanks to some unique specifications, including a 
24-fret, 25.5” scale length wide thin satin maple neck with 20” radius 
ebony fretboard. Holcomb’s signature pickups provide the right amount of
 output and articulation whether you’re playing sophisticated chords or 
solos and whether you’re playing alone or working in the mix of a band.

Ships FREE with a PRS Multi-Fit Hard Shell Case!
The PRS Silver Sky is an idealized version of a vintage single-coil 
guitar where every detail adds up and sets this guitar apart from the 
pack and the past. The result of a close collaboration between Grammy 
Award-winning musician John Mayer and Paul Reed Smith, the Silver Sky is
 based off of years of development. Incorporating Mayer and 
Smith’s favorite elements of 1963 and 1964 instruments with an eye 
toward modern references, the PRS Silver Sky delivers the warmth and 
familiarity of an old guitar with the finesse of a brand-new instrument. Some
 of the more distinctive specifications include, the headstock shape, 
tuners, bridge, pickups, and neck and fretboard options. The headstock 
shape is based on PRS’s trademark design, but inverted both to 
accommodate Mayer’s playing style and also to keep a consistent length 
of string behind the nut, which makes staying in tune easier. The tuners
 are a traditional vintage-style, closed-back tuner, but with PRS’s 
locking design. The steel tremolo takes the patented PRS design and 
incorporates Gen III knife-edge screws. Setup flush to the body in the 
neutral position so that the tremolo bridge only goes down in pitch, the
 bridge’s increased contact with the body allows the guitar itself to be
 acoustically louder, which in turn improves the signal to noise ratio 
of the single-coil pickups. The 635JM single-coil pickups are very round
 and full, with a musical high end that is never “ice-picky” or brash.

You are looking at serial #0305406 
Ships FREE with a PRS Multi-Fit Hard Shell Case!
The PRS Silver Sky is an idealized version of a vintage single-coil 
guitar where every detail adds up and sets this guitar apart from the 
pack and the past. The result of a close collaboration between Grammy 
Award-winning musician John Mayer and Paul Reed Smith, the Silver Sky is
 based off of years of development. Incorporating Mayer and 
Smith’s favorite elements of 1963 and 1964 instruments with an eye 
toward modern references, the PRS Silver Sky delivers the warmth and 
familiarity of an old guitar with the finesse of a brand-new instrument. Some
 of the more distinctive specifications include, the headstock shape, 
tuners, bridge, pickups, and neck and fretboard options. The headstock 
shape is based on PRS’s trademark design, but inverted both to 
accommodate Mayer’s playing style and also to keep a consistent length 
of string behind the nut, which makes staying in tune easier. The tuners
 are a traditional vintage-style, closed-back tuner, but with PRS’s 
locking design. The steel tremolo takes the patented PRS design and 
incorporates Gen III knife-edge screws. Setup flush to the body in the 
neutral position so that the tremolo bridge only goes down in pitch, the
 bridge’s increased contact with the body allows the guitar itself to be
 acoustically louder, which in turn improves the signal to noise ratio 
of the single-coil pickups. The 635JM single-coil pickups are very round
 and full, with a musical high end that is never “ice-picky” or brash.

 DW CE 24 Floyd model starts with the PRS CE bolt-on platform and 
includes a satin-finished maple neck, maple fretboard, a slightly 
modified Pattern Thin neck carve (Waring’s carve is slightly thinner 
front to back), and Floyd Rose tremolo system. The pickups and 
electronics are also unique to Waring’s signature axe. The pickups are 
Waring’s signature Mojotone “DW Tomahawk” pickups. Made with a blend of 
Ceramic and Alnico magnets and a special winding technique, DW Tomahawks
 have plenty of output and big bottom end while remaining articulate and
 clear - a unique quality for high gain pickups. Paired with a volume 
and tone control and 5-way blade pickup selector that have been shifted 
slightly to allow plenty of room to work the tremolo, the DW CE 24 
“Floyd” is comfortable, fun, and inspiring to play. The DW CE 24 “Floyd”
 comes with satin black hardware. Body Type: SolidbodyBody Shape: DW CE 24Left-/Right-handed: Right-handedNumber of Strings: 6Body Material: MahoganyTop Material: Figured MapleBody Finish: SatinColor: Faded Blue SmokeburstNeck Material: MapleNeck Shape: DWRadius: 10""Fingerboard Material: MapleFingerboard Inlay: PRS BirdsNumber of Frets: 24Scale Length: 25""Nut Width: 1.656""Nut Material: LockingBridge/Tailpiece: Floyd Rose 1000 TremoloTuners: PRS LockingNeck Pickup: Mojotone DW Tomahawk HumbuckerBridge Pickup: Mojotone DW Tomahawk HumbuckerControls: 1 x master volume, 1 x master tone, 5-way blade pickup switchStrings: PRS, .010-.046Case Included: PRS Hard Case

Introducing the Fender American Ultra Stratocaster: Fender's 
high-performance iteration of the modern Stratocaster. It offers several
 upgrades over traditional designs, including Fender's latest Ultra 
Noiseless Vintage Strat pickups, a 10""–14"" compound radius fingerboard 
on an effortless Modern ""D"" neck, and S-1 switching to roll in fat neck 
tones on pickup positions 1 and 2. Even if you're a traditionally bent 
player, don't be dismayed: the American Ultra Stratocaster is a Strat 
through and through. Its lightweight body is built from traditional 
Strat tonewoods (alder or ash, dependent on color) and outfitted with a 
flawless gloss poly finish and coordinating pickguard. Sealed locking 
tuners and a 2-point Deluxe Synchronised Trem with pop-in arm equip 
today's players for classic Strat colorization with demanding modern 
intonation. One feature all our reviewers were quick to note is the 
tapered low-profile neck heel, which gives you access to fret positions 
you'd never dare into on your vintage Strat. The whole instrument has 
been thought out and designed in painstaking detail, all the way down to
 the embossed Fender headstock logo and extra comfortable trem arm.

C&M is a proud PRS authorized dealer
Serial Number: C24231

Weight: 7lbs 12oz
The PRS 35th Anniversary SE Custom 24 is here to celebrate 35 years of guitar making and innovation. Designed around the one that started it all, the Custom 24, this limited-edition model captures the foundational elements of an iconic model and adds the musical functionality of the Paul’s Guitar, creating a new, versatile platform. The 35th Anniversary SE Custom 24 features TCI “S” treble and bass pickups with two mini-toggle switches that allow players to put either or both pickups in humbucking or true single-coil mode. The clarity and unique tones of these vintage-inspired pickups are both big and nuanced, so players can easily find their sweet spot.
Additional features include a 24-fret wide thin neck, abalone “old school” birds, and PRS’s patented tremolo design.
After selling out of all 3,500 Black Gold Wrap Burst 35th Anniversary SE Custom 24 Guitars, PRS is offering a second run of this model in Faded Blue Burst. Fewer than 3,000 Faded Blue Burst guitars will be available worldwide.

Fender's 5th-gen noiseless pickups, called Ultra Noiseless, land you all the spanky, quacky Strat goodness without any annoying hum. Seriously — plug it into a Plexi and crank it. The Ultra Noiseless Vintage Strat pickups remain full of character and light on noise. The American Ultra Strat has a silky-smooth 5-way switch that gives you loads of tones to choose from. When you engage the volume knob's S-1 Switch, you can add neck-position tones to positions 1 and 2 — position 1 giving you bridge and neck pickups together, position 2 giving you all three pickups at once.

Lafayette, LA 70506*FREE SHIPPING - USA ONLY* The
 PRS Silver Sky is an idealized version of a vintage single-coil guitar 
where every detail adds up and sets this guitar apart from the pack and 
the past. The result of a close collaboration between Grammy 
Award-winning musician John Mayer and Paul Reed Smith, the Silver Sky is
 based off of years of development. Incorporating Mayer and Smith’s 
favorite elements of 1963 and 1964 instruments with an eye toward modern
 references, the PRS Silver Sky delivers the warmth and familiarity of 
an old guitar with the finesse of a brand-new instrument. Some
 of the more distinctive specifications include, the headstock shape, 
tuners, bridge, pickups, and neck and fretboard options. The headstock 
shape is based on PRS’s trademark design, but inverted both to 
accommodate Mayer’s playing style and also to keep a consistent length 
of string behind the nut, which makes staying in tune easier. The tuners
 are a traditional vintage-style, closed-back tuner, but with PRS’s 
locking design. The steel tremolo takes the patented PRS design and 
incorporates Gen III knife-edge screws. Setup flush to the body in the 
neutral position so that the tremolo bridge only goes down in pitch, the
 bridge’s increased contact with the body allows the guitar itself to be
 acoustically louder, which in turn improves the signal to noise ratio 
of the single-coil pickups. The 635JM single-coil pickups are very round
 and full, with a musical high end that is never “ice-picky” or brash. Body Type: SolidbodyBody Shape: Silver SkyLeft-/Right-handed: Right-handedNumber of Strings: 6Body Material: AlderBody Finish: GlossColor: Polar BlueNeck Material: MapleNeck Shape: 635JMRadius: 7.25""Fingerboard Material: MapleFingerboard Inlay: PRS Bird OutlinesNumber of Frets: 22Scale Length: 25.5""Nut Width: 1.656""Nut Material: BoneBridge/Tailpiece: Steel TremoloTuners: Vintage Style LockingNeck Pickup: 635JM Single-coilMiddle Pickup: 635JM Single-coilBridge Pickup: 635JM Single-coilControls: 1 x master volume, 2 x tone, 5-way blade pickup switchStrings: PRS, .010-.046Case Included: Gig BagManufacturer Part Number: 107150:J0:13Wread more…",Paul Reed Smith,John Mayer Silver Sky,Solid Body,,

The PRS 35th Anniversary SE Custom 24 is here to celebrate 35 years of guitar making and innovation. Designed around the one that started it all, the Custom 24, this limited-edition model captures the foundational elements of an iconic model and adds the musical functionality of the Paul’s Guitar, creating a new, versatile platform. The 35th Anniversary SE Custom 24 features TCI “S” treble and bass pickups with two mini-toggle switches that allow players to put either or both pickups in humbucking or true single-coil mode. The clarity and unique tones of these vintage-inspired pickups are both big and nuanced, so players can easily find their sweet spot.
Additional features include a 24-fret wide thin neck, abalone “old school” birds, and PRS’s patented tremolo design.
After selling out of all 3,500 Black Gold Wrap Burst 35th Anniversary SE Custom 24 Guitars, PRS is offering a second run of this model in Faded Blue Burst. Fewer than 3,000 Faded Blue Burst guitars will be available worldwide.

This beautiful Fender is a special Limited Edition Acoustasonic Telecaster with a print of the American flag on the top of the body. This guitar boasts a hollow Telecaster inspired body, with a mahogany back and high-grade solid Sitka spruce top. It boasts a lovely armrest bevel that transforms into the body binding, and the mahogany neck is topped with a smooth ebony fingerboard. The body also incorporates the new Stringed Instrument Resonance System (SIRS), which allows for a lively, big, top response that rivals much larger acoustic guitar bodies. The American Acoustasonic Telecaster is loaded with the new Acoustic Engine, designed and built by Fender and Fishman. It provides a refined pallet of both electric and acoustic voices by allowing the blend of 10 different body style and tonewood combinations. A trio of pickups work together in conjunction to create your tones, including the Tele inspired Fender Acoustasonic Noiseless pickup, a Fishman Under-Saddle Transducer, and a Fishman Acoustasonic Enhancer. You even get a ""Mod"" knob to blend voices.

The PRS Special Semi-Hollow Limited Edition guitar offers players a versatile hum/single/hum configuration with two PRS 58/15 MT (Multi-Tap) humbuckers and a PRS Narrowfield middle pickup. The 58/15 MT’s offer all the tone of the originals while compensating for volume loss when split to single coils. The Narrowfield pickup delivers the bite of a single coil – without the hum but with plenty of clarity and punch. Paired with a 5-Way blade switch and two mini-toggles that tap the humbuckers, this guitar can handle myriad sounds and styles, and the semi-hollow body with single f-hole provides a welcome airiness and depth to the guitar’s tone.
The foundation of this guitar is very much like a Custom 22 – maple top, mahogany back, 22-fret 25” scale length mahogany neck, rosewood fretboard, Phase III tuners, and PRS Gen III patented tremolo – but the versatile electronics truly carry it to new sonic territory. The PRS Special Semi-Hollow made its debut at Experience PRS 2018.

Fresh from PRS! This is the Limited Edition Modern Eagle V in a beautiful 10 Top River Blue Smokewrap Burst from the 2020 Experience Event. 
The Smokewrap Burst finish blends well with the Dark Cherry stained backside of this guitar. Features a flamed mahogany neck and Honduran Rosewood Fretboard.
Ships FREE with its included Hard case and case candy!
Specially appointed to commemorate the 2020 Experience PRS event, which was celebrated virtually in May, this limited-edition Modern Eagle V is an innovative instrument that offers highly musical tones for both recording and playing live.
The Experience PRS 2020 Modern Eagle V utilizes a hum/single/hum (five-coil) pickup configuration and introduces a new and unique switching system that gives players a vast array of tones in one guitar. The 5-way blade switch selects the pickups just as the 509 does (treble, treble and middle, middle, middle and bass, bass). The two paired mini-toggles separate the slug-side coils, turning the hum- buckers into true, “TCI-tuned” single coils. There is a single volume and a push/pull tone control that activates both humbuckers when engaged; this allows players to access three pickups simultaneously. Finally, there is a third mini-toggle that changes the volume pot value from 500k to 250k, which gives the guitar a different palette of tones. This electronics design puts a whole set of classic and new tones at your fingertips.

Paul found a home at Ibanez and has been with the company for 30 years now. To celebrate this special anniversary Ibanez is announcing the release of the PGM333 30th Anniversary guitar.


This unique instrument carries with it all of the finest points of craftsmanship found on all Japanese-made Ibanez guitars. The guitar features an RG body shape, which seemed appropriate for the 30th anniversary model since it is reminiscent of Paul’s very first Ibanez PGM signature guitar.


The guitar features an African Mahogany Body and a 5-piece Maple/Walnut PGM neck. The neck is topped off with a Macassar Ebony fretboard featuring Abalone/Acrylic block inlays. The tonal engine that drives this instrument is a set of three DiMarzio PG-13 mini humbuckers. These are Paul’s signature pickups and though they are small, they offer a thick, lush, and powerful sound that offers instant voice and character to any guitar in which they’re installed.


The visual impact of the PGM333 is classic and also slightly understated thanks to its Champaign Gold finish and gold hardware. The guitar offers a simple, elegant aesthetic but last thing it would ever be called is ordinary. A hardshell case and a pack of PGM 30th Anniversary picks are also included.

 PRS Silver Sky is an idealized version of a vintage single-coil guitar 
where every detail adds up and sets this guitar apart from the pack and 
the past. The result of a close collaboration between Grammy 
Award-winning musician John Mayer and Paul Reed Smith, the Silver Sky is
 based off of years of development. Incorporating Mayer and Smith’s 
favorite elements of 1963 and 1964 instruments with an eye toward modern
 references, the PRS Silver Sky delivers the warmth and familiarity of 
an old guitar with the finesse of a brand-new instrument. Some
 of the more distinctive specifications include, the headstock shape, 
tuners, bridge, pickups, and neck and fretboard options. The headstock 
shape is based on PRS’s trademark design, but inverted both to 
accommodate Mayer’s playing style and also to keep a consistent length 
of string behind the nut, which makes staying in tune easier. The tuners
 are a traditional vintage-style, closed-back tuner, but with PRS’s 
locking design. The steel tremolo takes the patented PRS design and 
incorporates Gen III knife-edge screws. Setup flush to the body in the 
neutral position so that the tremolo bridge only goes down in pitch, the
 bridge’s increased contact with the body allows the guitar itself to be
 acoustically louder, which in turn improves the signal to noise ratio 
of the single-coil pickups. The 635JM single-coil pickups are very round
 and full, with a musical high end that is never “ice-picky” or brash. Body Type: SolidbodyBody Shape: Silver SkyLeft-/Right-handed: Right-handedNumber of Strings: 6Body Material: AlderBody Finish: GlossColor: Midnight Rose
